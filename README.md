## 🎯 The Problem

Most freelancers and small business owners sign contracts blindly because they cannot afford the **$300/hour legal fees** for professional review. A single "simple" agreement with unlimited liability can lead to catastrophic losses — like a colleague who lost **$50,000 in legal fees** over a single software bug.

**LexiNegotiate** was built to turn legal jargon into actionable financial data and empower users to negotiate with confidence.
